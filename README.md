# Robotics Arm: Pick & Place

### Forward and Inverse Kinematics - The Amazon Challenge Pick and Place Robot Kinematics project.

## Introduction

The object of the Pick and Place project is to write inverse kinematics formulae that implement the Amazon Pick and Place challenge, to correctly pick an item off a shelf at a random location and place it in a bin. To succeed the implementation must do this 8 out of 10 times.

Kinematics refers to position in space without regard to weights or forces. Inverse kinematics in this project involves the calculation of robot joint angles to position a Kuka KR210 robot arm at the position of an item so it can be grasped and follow a trajectory to release the item in a bin. Inverse kinematics is challenging as there are multiple solutions to the problem.

The project involves calculating the inverse kinemtics equations and modifying the file IK_server.py to implement the solution in the context of an RVIZ/Gazebo environment that has been set up by the course creators.

## The Process

1. Draw a schematic of the 6 degrees of freedom of the Kuka arm, label the joints and links.

2. Create a table of the distances from the base position.

3. Create a table of the DH parameters.

4. Create the forward kinematics matrices as sympy matrix types.

5. Create the inverse kinematics equations based on an analysis of the robot arm.

## Software Implementation

First I split IK_server.py into two modules - IK_server.py and IK_calcs.py for greater clarity. KI_server.py handles communications with the ROS system and IK_calcs handles the kinematic calculations.

### IK_calcs

IK_calcs.py has a **main** entry point so it can be run in test mode from the command line. IK_calcs.py is split into two sections: forward kinematics and inverse kinematics. The main function `IK_calcs()` accepts 3 dimensional point data, position data and pitch, roll, yaw parameters. It first calls the `evalf()` function on the forward kinematic matrix at the rest position as a sanity check. Next the inverse kinematic function `ReverseGeometryCalcs()` is called the evaluate the inverse kinematic formulae to create the ‚ç¨i values. The equations follow those developed in the analysis section. Note the addition of a call to the function `inrange()` which trims any angle calculations to be within the minima and maxima for the Kuka KR 210, taken from the Kuka documentation.

### Software Environment

The project runs on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and all the required software on an external USB drive bootable from a MacBook pro. The project uses the Kinetic version of ROS native on Ubuntu. The RoboND-Kinematics-Project environment is installed as per the class instructions.

### Results

After some trial and error tweaking parameters, the implementation successfully dropped 9 out of 10 cylinders in the bin, thus satisfying the project rubric.

The ninth cylinder goes in the bin:
